Kai Sheng Teh
This repository contains projects for Udacity's Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree. (It was known as Business Analyst Nanodegree back in 2017)

Part 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx
Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. Learn linear regression.

Project: Predicting Diamond Prices
Project: Predicting Catalog Demand
Part 2: Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx
Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Learn to write queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

Project: Data Cleanup
Project: Create Report from Database (SQL)
Part 3: Data Visualization in Tableau
Understand the importance of data visualization. Know how different data types are encoded in visualizations. Select the most effective chart or graph based on the data being displayed.

Project: Visualizing Movie Data
Part 4: Classification Models by Alteryx
You will use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

Project: Predicting Default Risk
Part 5: A/B Testing
Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

Project: A/B Test a New Menu Launch
Part 6: Time Series Forecasting
Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

Project: Forecast Video Game Sales
Part 7: Segmentation and Clustering
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model. Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.
